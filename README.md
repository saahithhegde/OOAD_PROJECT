# SUMMARY
CASH4BOOKS is an E-commerce website to buy and sell used books within the university community (UTD). It aims to provide a simple and a convenient way for students to buy and sell used books online. Students need to register using their Netid and Password to avail the services. Once registered they can login using those credentials. Students can either put a book on sale by entering a short description about its quality and can enter a price tag and ISBN or they can buy a book on sale using the various search parameters like ISBN, Subjects, Publishers, Price range etc. A user visiting the website can see a wide range of books arranged in respective categories. The user may select a desired book and view its price. The user may even search for specific books on the website through different filter criterias. Once the user has selected the desired book they can pay for it by entering the required details.

# Why CASH4BOOKS?
In recent years the demand for used books has increased significantly. This is mainly due to the fact that these books are available at a much cheaper rate than the fresh new copies. This becomes much more important as a student when you do not have any earning resources and are on a budget. As a student it will help you to save a considerable amount of your money.

This project also has an environmental significance. By encouraging the practice to buy and sell books online, people can contribute towards protecting the environment.This will help to decrease the production of new copies to a certain extent and help save natural resources.

CASH4BOOKS can even serve as a profit earning platform for students who wish to sell their old books that are no longer required and proves to be very cost effective for students wishing to buy it.
